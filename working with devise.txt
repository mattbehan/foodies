working with devise

# devise comes wit the methods:
# current_user - returns the current user
# user_signed_in - same as authenticated?
#sign_in(@user) and sign_out(@user) - devise created methods that will either sign users in our out
# user_session - returns metadata... by and large DO NOT USE

seed using 
user = user.create()
user.confirm! <-- uses the devise method confirm


allowing users to sign in via email or password is complicated but shouldn't take long

we allow unconfirmed access by toggling it in the initializer. it defaults to two months. This allows unconfirmed users to still login


overwrite after_inactive_sign_up_path_for in the devise controller to edit the default path
alternative would be to just set devise_for :users, controllers: { registrations: "reg`istrations" } in routes.rb, then overwriting the method in my own registrationscontroller that inherited from devisecontroller, however that never responded to any changes
update- fix was to say registrationsController <Devise::RegistrationsController and not DeviseController
it still responds to after_sign_up_path_for and not after_inactive_sign_up_path_for, probably because they are allowed to use the site for 7 days as I set it in config

when we want to push to production all we will have to do is set the environment variables for sendgrid username and password using-
heroku config:set SENDGRID_USERNAME

route for sending an invitation is users/invitation/new-- set a before_filter on that
